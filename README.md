# SortingBySim
Program that simulates the "sorting by" function in gamestore websites

Creates a class named "Consola" with the atributes "nombre", "precio", and "numJuegos", that correspond to the game name, price, and number of games respectively. 
Automatically creates 10 objects and adds them to an ArrayList. The program then asks the user to choose a sorting method (bubble or selection) and an atribute to sort by. Following this the program sorts the 10 objects and prints them accordingly.
